Welcome to Ben dot Place! A place to post with your friends!\n

This app is supposed to mimic the behaviour of 4chan, but in React.\n
\n

The > makes text green until next newline.\n

\n
RULES:\n
Have fun and be yourself!\n
Character limit of 3000, limit of 5 posts per 10 minutes.\n
I don't remember the image size limit.\n

There is not much else to it. It's an imageboard written in react.\n
